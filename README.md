## Project - Altering Method for Vertical to Horizontal Flight
Volansi Merck VOLY C10, C20, and M20 Utilize Fixed Horizontal and Vertical Rotors

Each design has four points of vertical lift for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). The use of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotors allow for typical Quad-Copter functionality.

One rotor is used for horizontal movement, in combination with wings allow for fixed-wing (airplane) flight. This is crucial for operating long distances, the use of wings and a single rotor reduces the energy required for flight.

Volansi's design allows for their aircraft to take off in tight spaces and have an easy transition to horizontal flight. In addition this allows for the aircraft to take-off and land either as a plane or a quad-copter. Multiple safety features such as having both wing and elevator flaps create backup systems incase a failure were to occur during operation.

### Vertical to Horizontal Rotor Transitioning
Concept: Utilize two of the vertical rotors to operate in a horizontal position, allowing for the removal of the single horizontal motor and rotor (weight reduction). The front rotor concept will be reviewed. The aft is a possiblity, but would potentially require the addition of another wing (tight on time). 
*Note - There is a possibility that Volansi has a reason for not having this in their current design, this is unknown.

Givens:
* Length of the aircraft is 9 feet, from visual proportions the forward structure holding rotors is estimated at 4 inches tall, assuming it's a cylinder. 
* Only designing for the Series 10 aircraft as they have single vertical rotors

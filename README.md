## Project - Altering Method for Vertical to Horizontal Flight
Volansi Merck VOLY C10, C20, and M20 utilize fixed horizontal and vertical Rotors

Each design has four points of vertical lift for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). The use of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotors allow for typical Quad-Copter functionality.

One rotor is used for horizontal movement, in combination with wings allow for fixed-wing (airplane) flight. This is crucial for operating long distances, the use of wings and a single rotor reduces consuption allowing for further distances.

Volansi's design allows for their aircraft to take off in tight spaces and have an easy transition to horizontal flight. In addition this allows for the aircraft to take-off and land either as a plane or a quad-copter. Multiple safety features, such as having both wing and elevator flaps, create backup systems incase a failure were to occur during operation.

### Vertical to Horizontal Rotor Transitioning
Concept: Utilize two of the vertical rotors to operate in a horizontal position, allowing for the removal of the single horizontal motor and rotor (weight reduction).
*Note - There is a possibility that Volansi has a reason for not having this in their current design, this is unknown. Also this is intended to be a new design, so no ability to recreate Wingcopter joints and avoid joints used in patent RU180474U1.

Givens:
* Length of the aircraft is 9 feet, from visual proportions the forward structure holding rotors is estimated at 4 inches tall, assuming it's a cylinder. 
* Only designing for the Series 10 aircraft as they have single vertical rotors
* The front rotor concept will be reviewed. The aft is a possiblity, but would potentially require the addition of another wing (tight on time). 
* Energy usage and weight reduction is assumed to make this project beneficial
* DC Motor that will be used is fairly small, to allow for a prototype 1/3 scale will be used

### Draft Designs
#### The Not So Simple Pivot
Using a 45 degree cut, its possible to have a quick swivle to the end of the structure, allowing a quick change from horizontal to vertical.

A simple 45 degree bevel spur gear was drawn to show a potential application. A final design would require a bearing to allow the joint to rotate smoothly. This gear box would be fairly complicated for the size, and the need for somewhat robost gears would add additional weight to the system that might counteract the benefits. 


#### Dragon's Neck
Using cone like structures multiple joints can be created to allow for streamline horizontal flight and a raised "arm" for vertical flight. Pins with slots allow the cones to fit within each other, and a maximum angle of 20 degrees between joints is possible. Tt is possible to redesign for each joint to have 22.5 degrees of freedom reducing the length of the assembly by one cone, but this will reduce the diameter of the electrical conduit that could run through the joints.

Comments:

Estimated Proportions of the motor used for the rotors vs the DC motor in my drawer. Really puts this into perspective.
